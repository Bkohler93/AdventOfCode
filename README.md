# AdventOfCode
Contains solutions to some of the yearly Advent of Code challenges.

I use these challenges to practice problem-solving and improve my programming skills. As of now solutions are all in a C++ program or in a webpage (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
Each folder contains challenges from one of the years Advent of Code took place. Inside each challenge folders contains the problem statement and a summary of my solution.
